# Comparing {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Classic and VPC infrastructure environments
{: #compare-infrastructure}

Compare the key differences between {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} infrastructure environments to decide which one is best for your workloads and applications.
{: shortdesc}

If you aren't familiar with the environment types, review the following descriptions.

* Classic infrastructure is our existing IaaS platform. This environment is best for lift and shift workloads so you can move applications quickly and keep the same architecture.
* VPC infrastructure is our new IaaS platform, based on software-defined networking and ideal for cloud-native applications.

Classic infrastructure and VPC infrastructure are cost neutral, so you can focus on what environment best meets your needs.

## Compute differentiators
{: #compare-compute}

See the following table for the compute differences between classic and VPC.

| Category   |  Classic Infrastructure   | VPC Infrastructure |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
|  **Services**  |Full catalog of services, such as {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}, {{site.data.keyword.BluVirtServers_short}} instances, VMware, SAP | {{site.data.keyword.BluVirtServers_short}} instances only |
| **Performance and availability** | | Better availability achievable through zone architecture |
| **Pricing** | Hourly and monthly billing, plus suspend billing features | Hourly, suspend billing, and sustained usage discount |
| **Virtual server families** | Public, dedicated, transient, reserved | Public, Dedicated |
| **Profiles** | All profiles, including the GPU profiles | Balanced, compute, memory profiles with higher RAM and vCPU options |
| **Supported images** | Full set of pre-stock images, plus custom images | Limited set of pre-stock images, plus the ability to import a custom image |
| **Platform integration** | | IAM and resource group integration for a unified experience |

To understand the differences between environments, navigate to the row and find the details for the feature that you're interested in."}

## Network differentiators
{: #compare-network}

See the following table for the networking differences between classic and VPC.

| Category   |  Classic infrastructure   | VPC infrastructure |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Location construct**    | Data centers and PODs <br>(Might require VLAN spanning to connect two different pods or data centers, and purchasing gateways to control and route traffic) | Regional model that abstracts infrastructure so you don't need to worry about pod locations.|
| **Network functions and services** |Physical and virtual appliances from multiple vendors | Cloud-native network functions (VPNs, LBaaS)<br>(VPC isolation, dedicated resources carved out of public cloud, with more options for VPNs, LBaaS, multiple vNIC instances, and larger subnet sizes) |
| **IP addresses** | IPv6 addresses supported | IPv4 addresses only |
| **Gateway routin**g | Use a virtual or physical network appliance (Virtual Router Appliance, Vyatta, Juniper vSRX, Fortinet FSA) | Traffic routing is handled by public gateway and floating IP services |
| **Network address translation (NAT)** | Use a virtual or physical network appliance (Virtual Router Appliance, Vyatta, Juniper vSRX, Fortinet FSA) | Supported by the Bring-your-own-IP (BYOIP) functionality  |
| **IPsec Virtual private network (VPN)** | Use a virtual or physical network appliance (Virtual Router Appliance, Vyatta, Juniper vSRX, Fortinet FSA) | Supported by the VPN-as-a-service offering |
|  **Elastic load balancing** | Cloud Load Balancer  | Load Balancer for VPC |
| **Global load balancing**| Cloud Internet Services, Citrix Netscaler MPX | Cloud Internet Services |
|**Hybrid connectivity** | NAT solution to bridge between IBM Cloud and your IT environment | Bring your own private IP address without NAT or IPSec tunnels <br>Note: You can enable your VPC to access classic infrastructure resources. |

## Storage differentiators
{: #compare-storage}

See the following table for the storage differences between classic and VPC.

|  Classic infrastructure   | VPC infrastructure |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
|Robust set of storage services, block storage (iSCSI), and file storage (NFS-based) offerings| Block storage as primary boot disk (with basic lifecycle management), and secondary data volumes  <br> Note: Volume encryption is available during provisioning.|

## Security differentiators
{: #compare-security}

See the following table for the security differences between classic and VPC.

|  Classic infrastructure   | VPC infrastructure |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
|Vyatta, Fortigate, Juniper vSRX, Security Groups for virtual servers| Security groups, Network access control lists (ACLs)|
{: caption="Table 4. Security comparison" caption-side="top"}

## API differentiators
{: #compare-apis}

See the following table for the API differences between classic and VPC.

|  Classic infrastructure   | VPC infrastructure |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ |
|Existing {{site.data.keyword.slapi_short}} (SLAPI)| New developer-friendly, REST-based API |
