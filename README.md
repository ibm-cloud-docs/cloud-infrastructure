# Cloud infrastructure documentation repo README file

You can submit suggested changes to any existing documentation page by using the "Edit topic" button at the end of each page. By following that link and editing the page, you can submit updates in a pull request (PR). See [Submitting pull requests](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/writing?topic=writing-pr) for more information. 

If you require brand new topics or updates for a new feature, follow the [Client Services Feature Intake Process](https://confluence.swg.usma.ibm.com:8445/display/UI/Client+Services+Feature+Intake+Process)

When you open a pull request, make sure that you tag the request with a severity label. The severity levels are as follows. The timeline indicates only when a JIRA work item is created and the GitHub issue is updated with the JIRA information. Timeline for completion of work depends on what is needed for a solution.

| Severity | Label | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sev 1 | `ci-sev1` | Content error causes data loss or broken environment. These issues will be addressed as soon as possible. A Jira work item and the GitHub issue is updated within 24 hours. |
| Sev 2 | `ci-sev2` | Incorrect instructions; user can’t proceed to successfully complete a task. These issues will be addressed in the next two-week sprint or earlier if the task is high priority. A Jira work item and the GitHub issue is updated within 48 hours. |
| Sev 3 | `ci-sev3` | Content enhancement would be helpful to user. This issue is added to the documentation backlog and will be addressed as prioritization allows. A Jira work item and the GitHub issue is updated within 1 week. |
| Sev 4 | `ci-sev4` | Typos, misspellings, formatting, and other style issues. This issue is added to the documentation backlog and will be addressed as prioritization allows. A Jira work item and the GitHub issue is updated within 1 week. |
