# Planning your infrastructure
{: #planning-2}

You want to plan your infrastructure before you provision it to make sure that you size it correctly for your workload. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} has several tools and sites to help you with designing and sizing your infrastructure.

## Infrastructure architecture
{: #planning-3}

Start with [IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas){: external} to get a more in-depth overview of the infrastructure-as-a-service platform and architecture.

## {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Stencils
{: #planning-5}

Create a diagram of your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} architecture by using popular diagramming tools, [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Stencils](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/architecture-icons){: external} and [ibmdiagrams](https://github.com/ibm/ibmdiagrams){: external}. 

## {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} cost estimator
{: #planning-6}

Use the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} cost estimator](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-calculator){: external} to find the lowest cost estimate for the configuration that suits you best. Use this cloud price calculator to configure {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} products and to generate reliable cost estimates.

## {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services and compliance
{: #planning-7}

As with any architecture, consider the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources that you might add to your solution as you size your infrastructure. For more information, see [What are Iaas, Paas and Saas?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas-paas-saas){: external} and search for a specific service. You also need to think about any regulations that you must consider when you build your architecture. For example, is your workload considered sensitive or is it regulated? For more information, see [Compliance](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance){: external}.

## {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IP ranges
{: #planning-ip-ranges}

See [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} IP ranges](/docs/cloud-infrastructure?topic=cloud-infrastructure-ibm-cloud-ip-ranges).

## Next steps
